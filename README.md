## Developer Comments

First impressions of React Native was of how simple it was to transition from React to building an app with React Native and Expo.  I first wanted to build something small, simple and achievable, and just focus on learning React Native so I can build something larger with a backend.  This project is an app version of my React portfolio project '[xandinho](https://github.com/x4ndez/xandinho)'.  Simply, it pulls my GitHub repositories and forms a list with the data collected from the API request.  Happy to say I'm excited to build my next app!
